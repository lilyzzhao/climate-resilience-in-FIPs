ERA 1.1.1,Stock status outcome,Population abundance-C1/1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute of Population abundance. The indicator aims to directly evaluate population abundance of the target stock (e.g., requirements regarding B current), and a high PI score requires that ""there is some quantitative evidence that the stock is healthy with no conflicting information."" These requirements correspond with the attribute in terms of a focus on high abundance or biomass of a species within a defined geographic range. Thus, the indicator fully addresses the conceptual aspects of the attribute."
ERA 1.1.1,Stock status outcome,Age structure-C1/1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute of Age structure. Using the data-limited pathway, the PI directly mentions age structure being stable over time as evidence related to stock health. Under the non-data-limited pathway, spawning stock biomass (SSB) is mentioned as a common PI that fishery management bodies use in setting target reference points, such that age structure is often first considered in the evaluation of the PI but not necessarily so."
ERA 1.2.1,Harvest strategy,Responsive-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Responsive. Achieving a high PI score where ""the harvest strategy is responsive to the state of stock"" provides some evidence of responsiveness in management actions. However, beyond this, the PI does not include the extent to which disturbances are handled and resolved with sensitivity, readiness, speed, and accuracy iteratively. Thus, the indicator cannot be said to moderately correspond with the attribute component."
ERA 1.2.3,Information and monitoring,Knowledge diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Achieving the high PI score requirement of ""sufficient relevant information related to stock structure, stock productivity, fleet composition and other data are available to support the harvest strategy"" partially indicates and aims to assess the extent of information available to support the harvest strategy. However, the variety of origins in knowledge sources is missing, which is a key concept within this attribute. Moreover, individuals and communities do not necessarily themselves have a variety of knowledge sources from different origins."
ERA 1.2.3,Information and monitoring,Age structure-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Age structure. Achieving the high PI score requirement of ""sufficient relevant information related to stock structure"" would directly support/provide some evidence of understanding stock structure. However, the PI cannot be said to partially indicate or assess the extent to which the age distribution of individuals within the fished population is intact and well-distributed."
ERA 1.2.4,Assessment of stock status,Knowledge diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Achieving the high PI score requirement of ""an assessment has been recently conducted that is appropriate to the stock and HCRs"" provides some evidence of the variety of information available. However, the PI does not directly partially indicate or aim to assess knowledge diversity but includes a type of information that contributes to knowledge diversity. This information and that of related PIs relate to Western fisheries science rather than a diversity of knowledge sources. Additionally, the availability of this information to individuals and members of the community is not included in this PI."
ERA 2.2.1,Other species outcome,Species diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Species diversity. Achieving the PI score requirement that ""main secondary species are highly likely to be above biologically based limits"" is within the scope of the attribute component Species diversity. However, the PI does not directly partially indicate or aim to assess the level of diversity of species within the broader ecosystem. The PI considers the fishery's impact on ""main species"" outside the fishery but does not consider or partially evaluate community diversity. Thus, the indicator cannot be said to partially indicate the attribute component."
ERA 2.2.3,Other species information,Knowledge diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Requiring ""qualitative information is adequate to estimate the impact of the UoA on the main non-target species"" provides some evidence of a type of information that contributes to knowledge diversity. However, this information and that of related PIs relate to Western fisheries science rather than a diversity of knowledge sources. Additionally, the availability of this information to individuals and members of the community is not included in this PI."
ERA 2.3.3,ETP species information,Knowledge diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Requiring ""adequate relevant information is collected to support management of UoA impacts on ETP species"" does not directly partially indicate or aim to assess knowledge diversity but includes a type of information that contributes to knowledge diversity. However, this information and that of related PIs relate to Western fisheries science rather than a diversity of knowledge sources. Additionally, the availability of this information to individuals and members of the community is not included in this PI."
ERA 2.4.1,Habitats outcome,Habitat diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Habitat diversity. Achieving the PI score requirement of ""the UoA is highly unlikely to reduce structure and function of the commonly encountered habitats to a point where there would be serious or irreversible harm"" provides an example of a requirement that supports habitat quality. However, the PI cannot be said to partially indicate or aim to assess the range of suitable, adjacent, and available habitats that a target fish population can exploit."
ERA 2.4.2,Habitats management,Habitat diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Habitat diversity. Achieving the PI score requirement of ""there is a partial strategy in place, if necessary, that is expected to ensure the UoA is highly unlikely to reduce structure and function of the commonly encountered and VME habitats to a point where there would be serious or irreversible harm"" directly supports Habitat diversity. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the range of suitable, adjacent, and available habitats that a target fish population can exploit."
ERA 2.4.3,Habitats information,Knowledge diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Achieving the PI score requirement of ""information is adequate to determine the risk posed to habitats by the UoA"" would directly provide information that contributes to the diversity of knowledge sources. However, this information and that of related PIs relate to Western fisheries science rather than a diversity of knowledge sources. Additionally, the availability of this information to individuals and members of the community is not included in this PI."
ERA 2.5.1,Ecosystem outcome,Ecosystem connectivity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Ecological connectivity. Achieving the PI score requirement of ""the UoA is highly unlikely to disrupt the key ecosystem elements to a point where there would be a serious or irreversible harm"" directly supports maintaining ecosystem connectivity. However, the PI does not partially indicate or aim to assess the degree to which an ecosystem facilitates structural and physical connectivity among ecosystem functions and components beyond fishery impacts. The PI implies measurements of structural and physical connectivity through ""key ecosystem elements,"" but does not specifically state this."
ERA 2.5.3,Ecosystem information,Knowledge diversity-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Achieving the PI score requirement of ""information is adequate to determine the risk posed to the ecosystem by the UoA"" would directly provide a type of information that contributes to the diversity of knowledge sources. However, this information and that of related PIs relate to Western fisheries science rather than a diversity of knowledge sources. Additionally, the availability of this information to individuals and members of the community is not included in this PI."
ERA 3.1.1,Legal and/or customary framework,Accountable-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Accountable (in regards to being held culpable to higher-level mandates, commitments, goals, and objectives). Achieving the high PI score requirement of ""there is an effective national legal system and organized and effective cooperation with other parties, where necessary, to deliver the management outcomes"" would directly support/provide some evidence of accountability to higher-level objectives, but attribute concepts are not given sufficient attention."
ERA 3.1.1,Legal and/or customary framework,Transparent-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Transparent (in terms of available to the public and in a timely manner). Requiring ""a transparent mechanism for the resolution of legal disputes"" is within the scope of the attribute component Transparent. Having a transparent mechanism for resolution of legal disputes is one aspect of transparent governance. However, the transparency of other types of management-related information is not addressed in this attribute. The timely nature of information accessibility regarding the resolution of legal disputes as part of transparency could be better articulated."
ERA 3.1.1,Legal and/or customary framework,Efficient and effective-C1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute Efficient and effective (in terms of effectiveness). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""there is an effective national legal system and organised and effective cooperation with other parties, where necessary, to deliver the management outcomes"" aims to directly confer effective fisheries governance and includes all aspects of this component conceptually. However, the ability of the government to use resources efficiently is not included in this PI."
ERA 3.1.1,Legal and/or customary framework,Equitable and inclusive-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). Achieving the PI score requirement of ""the management system has a mechanism to observe the legal rights created explicitly or established by custom of people dependent on fishing for food or livelihood"" provides an example of an activity that directly supports procedural equity. However, the PI does not partially indicate or aim to assess whether or not the management system is procedurally equitable and engaged and inclusive of marginalized and disadvantaged groups beyond observing rights. Procedural equity involves more than observing rights; it includes achieving fairness and preventing harm in processes."
ERA 3.1.2,"Consultation, roles, and responsibilities",Participatory-C1/1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute of Participatory. The requirements that ""The consultation process provides opportunity for all interested and affected parties to give input regarding decisions,"" and that ""The management system includes consultation processes that regularly seek and accept relevant information, including local knowledge,"" aims to ensure effective consultation very closely related to stakeholders' participation. A high score would indicate that the government encourages citizen involvement regularly, which implies both short- and long-term time scales described in the attribute, such that this indicator largely includes all conceptual aspects of this attribute. However, the empowering participants and sharing control aspects of the attribute could be a little better considered by indicator. See examples in SRA 1.2.1 and 2.1.2 for how these concepts could be better captured."
ERA 3.1.2,"Consultation, roles, and responsibilities",Polycentric-C1/1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute of Polycentric. The PI evaluates consultation, roles, and responsibilities; in doing so, the PI also partially considers and assesses the degree to which multiple governing bodies overlap and interact to make and enforce policy. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""functions, roles and responsibilities are explicitly defined and well understood for key areas of responsibility and interaction"" would indicate a strong presence of interaction among multiple governing bodies, whereas its inverse would suggest limited polycentric governance. However, the PI does not specifically measure polycentricity or overlap at the government level and does not mention the prevention of corruption."
ERA 3.1.2,"Consultation, roles, and responsibilities",Knowledge diversity-C1/1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute of Knowledge diversity. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""the management system includes consultation processes that regularly seek and accept relevant information, including local knowledge"" would indicate a strong presence of knowledge diversity in the area and its use in the management system, whereas its inverse would suggest limited knowledge diversity. However, the PI does not fully consider or evaluate the degree of variety in the origins of knowledge sources available to individuals and members of the community; i.e., individuals and communities do not necessarily themselves have a variety of knowledge sources from different origins."
ERA 3.1.2,"Consultation, roles, and responsibilities",Efficient and effective-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Efficient and effective (in terms of efficiency). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""functions, roles and responsibilities are explicitly defined and well understood for key areas of responsibility and interaction"" would directly support efficient governance by clarifying processes and reducing redundancies. However, the indicator does not sufficiently consider or evaluate the efficiency of resource use within the governance system such that there is minimal conceptual overlap with the attribute component."
ERA 3.2.2,Decision-making processes,Access to knowledge-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in regards to equitable access). The PI evaluates decision-making processes; in doing so, the PI also partially considers and assesses the extent to which individuals and communities have equitable access to the variety of existing knowledge about the system. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""information on the fishery’s performance and management action is available on request, and explanations are provided"" would indicate some access to knowledge, whereas its inverse would suggest limited access to knowledge. The PI in general considers management access to best available information but does not describe the ability of individuals and communities to derive benefit from such knowledge. Including access to fisheries information for supply chain actors in this PI would increase the ability of ERA to drive progress towards transparency and access to knowledge."
ERA 3.2.2,Decision-making processes,Transparent-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Transparent (in terms of available to the public and in a timely manner). The PI assesses decision-making processes; in doing so, the PI also partially considers and assesses the degree to which information regarding decision-making is available to the public or affected stakeholders in a timely manner. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""information on the fishery’s performance and management action is available on request, and explanations are provided"" indicates some transparency, whereas its inverse would suggest limited transparency. However, the PI could better incorporate transparency by suggesting that information be accessible, more clearly available, and interpretable to different audiences rather than solely available on request."
ERA 3.2.3,Compliance and enforcement,Efficient and effective-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Efficient and effective (in terms of effectiveness). The PI evaluates compliance and enforcement; in doing so, the PI also partially considers and assesses the ability of governance to produce outcomes that achieve societal and/or fishery objectives. Efficient use of available resources is not discussed in relation to the relevant management measures, but the effectiveness of compliance and enforcement is considered. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""an MCS system has been implemented in the fishery and has demonstrated an ability to enforce relevant management measures"" would partially indicate presence of effective governance in achieving objectives, whereas its inverse would suggest limited effectiveness in governance. The extent to which the governance system produces outcomes that achieve societal and/or fishery objectives is considered but only in relation to compliance with management."
ERA 3.2.4,Monitoring and management performance evaluation,Accountable-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Accountable (in terms of being held culpable to both individuals and communities). Achieving the PI score requirement of ""there are mechanisms in place to evaluate all parts... of the fishery-specific management system"" would directly support/provide some evidence of accountability. However, an evaluation system is not the same as an accountability system. Management is held to established rules and objectives, but is not necessarily held culpable, which is required for a higher correspondence score given the scope of the assessment and attribute component."
ERA 3.2.4,Monitoring and management performance evaluation,Adaptive-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Adaptive. Achieving the PI score requirement of ""there are mechanisms in place to evaluate all parts... of the fishery-specific management system"" is within the scope of the attribute component Adaptive. Achieving the high PI score requirement would directly support/provide some evidence of learning capacity through regular evaluation, which is a small aspect of the attribute component. Regular evaluation implies but does not specify that management would adapt based on these evaluations (i.e., the learning but not adjustment portion of the adaptive attribute is considered)."
SRA 1.1.1,Abuse and harassment,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""workers have grievance procedures to report harassment and do not face retaliation for using them"" would directly support/provide some evidence of a small aspect of agency by not facing retaliation. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the broader capacity of individuals and communities to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will."
SRA 1.1.1,Abuse and harassment,Accountable-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Accountable (in terms of being held culpable to both individuals and communities). Achieving the high PI score requirement of ""there is an effective national legal system and organised and effective cooperation with other parties, where necessary, to deliver the management outcomes"" would directly support or provide some evidence of accountability to higher-level objectives, but an accountability system is not mentioned. Thus, this indicator does not partially indicate or aim to assess the component."
SRA 1.1.1,Abuse and harassment,Accountable-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Accountable (in regard to being held culpable to higher-level mandates, commitments, goals, and objectives). A high PI score involves written policies and holding violators accountable to policies with disciplinary procedures. However, the degree to which decision-makers are held accountable to higher-level mandates is not considered."
SRA 1.1.2,"Human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage",Wealth and reserves-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Wealth and reserves. Withholding of wages would indicate the inability to accumulate assets and reserves, but this is a small component of what is needed to accumulate wealth and reserves."
SRA 1.1.2,"Human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage",Accountable-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Accountable (in regards to being held culpable to higher-level mandates, commitments, goals, and objectives). The high PI score requirement that the ""Farm or fishery publicly discloses their social, economic, and environmental performance, AND Farm or fishery has published social responsibility and environmental policies"" demonstrates a commitment to broader objectives and allows for accountability to higher-level mandates. However, no accountability system is directly mentioned such that being held culpable is only partially conceptually considered."
SRA 1.1.2,"Human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage",Access to economic opportunity-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling non-physical means). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""workers/fishers/farmers are paid at least monthly"" directly supports access to economic opportunity by preventing wage withholding. However, while withholding of wages would indicate the inability to access economic opportunity, this is a small aspect of what is needed to access economic opportunity in terms of non-physical means and processes."
SRA 1.1.2,"Human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage",Mobility-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Mobility (for individual fishers and fish workers). It indicates the ability of individuals to move freely but not of communities, nor does it indicate the ability to move easily."
SRA 1.1.2,"Human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage",Agency-C1/1,2,The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute of Agency. Agency of individuals is inherently low if the PI score is low. Conditions needed for agency are included in this PI.
SRA 1.1.3,Child labor,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""the farm or fishery has a child labor policy that ensures the best interests of the child"" would directly support the agency of children. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the capacity of individuals and communities more broadly to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will."
SRA 1.1.4,Freedom of association and collective bargaining,Social capital-C1,1,The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Social capital (for between individuals). Training implies the potential of collective bargaining to exist. Only the final sentence regarding women's participation in unions indicates that these groups actually exist.
SRA 1.1.4,Freedom of association and collective bargaining,Access to knowledge-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (with regard to equitable access). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""workers/fishers/farmers are trained by workers’ organizations on their rights to organize and bargain collectively"" directly supports equitable access to information in terms of their right to organize, although equitable access regarding the variety of information needed from an employer to collectively bargain effectively is not considered, nor is equitable access to additional available information within the scope of fishery operations and employment considered."
SRA 1.1.4,Freedom of association and collective bargaining,Agency-C1/1,2,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. The indicator measures agency via policies and by-laws, which covers basic human rights, and freedom to negotiate and bargain implies the other component of agency. This indicator only strengthens one aspect of agency relevant to individuals in this context."
SRA 1.1.5,Earnings and benefits,Adaptive-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Adaptive. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""the employer and workers discuss how they can improve wages and productivity in mutually beneficial ways"" would directly support/provide some evidence for an example of the potential for adaptation. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the actual implementation of new innovations that contribute to robust and flexible action in the face of uncertainty. Discussing how they can improve wages and productivity indicates potential adjustment but does not guarantee it, which would be needed for evidence of adaptiveness."
SRA 1.1.5,Earnings and benefits,Equitable and inclusive-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""Both domestic law and practices and policies of the fishery/farm uphold the principles of equal remuneration for men and women"" would directly indicate procedural equity in terms of upholding rights of men and women, while its inverse would suggest the opposite. However, inclusivity and consideration of whether marginalized and disadvantaged groups are engaged in decision-making and fairness more generally are not fully considered by this indicator. Thus, conceptual overlap with this component of the attribute is moderate."
SRA 1.1.5,Earnings and benefits,Wealth and reserves-C1/1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute of Wealth and reserves. It partially indicates wealth and reserves by ensuring wages or earnings are higher than minimum legal levels, although earnings could be high yet reserves still low or tied to specific assets (e.g., fishing assets), which could make some fishers more or less vulnerable to climate change impacts depending on context."
SRA 1.1.5,Earnings and benefits,Access to economic opportunity-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling non-physical means). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""wages or earnings are higher than minimum legal wages or meet living wage levels (includes being able to provide for family, save, or invest)"" directly supports access to financial opportunity; however, the potential for workers to benefit from new or alternative income-earning activities is not included."
SRA 1.1.5,Earnings and benefits,Equitable and inclusive-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of distributional equity). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""Both domestic law and practices and policies of the fishery/farm uphold the principles of equal remuneration for men and women"" aims to ensure distributional equality in outcomes via processes. Ensuring equal pay and benefits would often directly imply distributional equity, although fairness and burdens are not considered. Thus, conceptual overlap with this component of the attribute is moderate but not strong. Notably, in this scoring, the attribute and the mechanism of the attribute themselves are written in terms of processes, while distributional equity often encompasses realized outcomes to a greater extent."
SRA 1.1.7,Access to basic services,Mobility-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Mobility (for individual fishers and fisherworkers). Sleeping quarters cannot be locked from the outside, which is a small aspect of individual mobility. Community mobility is not mentioned."
SRA 1.1.7,Access to basic services,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""sleeping quarters or sanitation facilities cannot be locked from the outside (restriction of movement is prevented)"" would provide some evidence of individuals' capacity to act on their own free will by preventing restriction of movement. More broadly, while access to basic services is often correlated with and underlies agency, it does not necessarily imply agency. Access to basic services and not having sleeping quarters locked from the outside must be fulfilled for individuals to have the capacity to act on their own free will, but this PI only measures a few of the circumstances needed for the capacity of individuals to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will."
SRA 1.1.7,Access to basic services,Participatory-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Participatory. Fishers and management meet regularly (covers both short- and long-term time scales) to discuss vessel or housing improvements, indicating participation in decision-making regarding living arrangements but does not indicate degree of influence such that conceptually this requirement represents a small aspect of the attribute."
SRA 1.1.8,Occupational safety,Access to knowledge-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in regards to equitable access). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""workers/fishers/farmers and managers are trained in health and safety procedures and on proper use of PPE and safe operation of any equipment they use"" directly supports access to specific knowledge about health and safety. Workers trained in health and safety procedures indicates one example of access to knowledge, but this PI does not describe equitable access to information or accessibility to other forms of safety information (e.g., climate change related, weather forecasting, etc.) or fishery operations."
SRA 1.1.8,Occupational safety,Equitable and inclusive-C2,2,The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). Special protections for vulnerable workers are part of equitable practice and are an example of procedural equity.
SRA 1.2.1,Customary use rights,Participatory-C1/1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute of Participatory as community being strongly involved in management indicates citizen involvement in decision-making, both intermittently and long-term. The indicator aims to empower participation and facilitate shared control in decision-making as requirements include ""traditional practices and knowledge are incorporated into resource management"" and ""special attention is paid to ensure women and disadvantaged groups are included in consultation."" Thus, the indicator fully addresses the conceptual aspects of the attribute."
SRA 1.2.2,Corporate responsibility and transparency,Transparent-C2,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute Transparent (regarding information being in a form accessible). A high PI score requires that ""The human rights policy is communicated and training is provided, in a language or medium understandable to all workers and observers on the fishing vessel and other relevant persons who assume the responsibility or duties for the operation of the fishing vessel or its workers."" This requirement directly aims to ensure that information regarding decision-making is in an accessible form for stakeholders, thus all conceptual aspects of the attribute component are considered."
SRA 1.2.2,Corporate responsibility and transparency,Transparent-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Transparent (in terms of available to the public and in a timely manner). A high PI score involves the fishery publicly disclosing its social, economic, and environmental performance, indicating information accessibility, availability, and transparency across multiple management areas. However, the timeliness of available information is not mentioned."
SRA 1.2.2,Corporate responsibility and transparency,Accountable-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Accountable (in regard to being held culpable to higher-level mandates, commitments, goals, and objectives). Published policies demonstrate commitment to broader objectives, but the effectiveness depends on enforcement and adherence, partially indicating accountability to higher-level mandates."
SRA 2.1.1,Grievance reporting and access to remedy,Accountable-C1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute Accountable (in terms of being held culpable to both individuals and communities). The high PI score requirements ""Workers/fishers/farmers have access to third-party independent organizations or local/customary governance bodies that can address grievances and ensure effective representation,"" and that ""These remediation processes (corrective action plans) are publicly disclosed,"" and that ""Grievance mechanisms are both procedurally and substantively effective at remediation of conflicts and complaints,"" aim to directly hold violators and company decision-makers culpable to individuals and include all aspects of this component conceptually, but do not consider accountability of state governance actors."
SRA 2.1.1,Grievance reporting and access to remedy,Equitable and inclusive-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). Employer grievance mechanisms that provide special consideration to marginalized groups are part of equitable and inclusive procedures for industry governance, but this indicator does not include distributional equity outright, nor does its scope extend beyond industry."
SRA 2.1.1,Grievance reporting and access to remedy,Accountable-C2,3,"The indicator also provides strong consideration of the attribute Accountable (in regards to being held culpable to higher-level mandates, commitments, goals, and objectives). A high PI score includes ""Workers/fishers/farmers have access to third-party independent organizations or local/customary governance bodies that can address grievances and ensure effective representation,"" and refers to resolutions in a ""time-bound manner with no recurring grievances."" These requirements aims to directly confer accountability to higher-level mandates such that the indicator largely includes all aspects of this component conceptually."
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Equitable and inclusive-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). It indicates procedural equity as consideration for vulnerable groups in decision-making processes, and decisions are made by affected stakeholders on equal terms, are included as requirements. Equitable and inclusive governance may be fully measured if considered in combination with indicators relating to distributional equity."
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Transparent-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Transparent (regarding being in a form accessible). The indicator suggests transparency in decision-making processes, but may not fully measure the accessibility of information to all stakeholders in forms that are understandable and timely."
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Participatory-C1/1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute of Participatory. The indicator aims to directly confer the attribute. High PI score requirements include that ""All affected and relevant stakeholders are free to engage in all aspects of fishery/aquaculture governance including decision-making, monitoring, enforcement, and conflict resolution,"" and ""Participation and collaborative management between local stakeholders and government... is fostered and reinforced by civil society organizations working to protect the interests of relevant stakeholders."" Thus, all aspects of the attribute are conceptually considered."
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Social capital-C2,2,The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Social capital (for between organizations). It implies bridging and linking social capital via collaborative management. Broad inclusivity is a small aspect of strong social networks between organizations.
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Social capital-C1,1,The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Social capital (for between individuals). It implies bridging and linking social capital via collaborative management. Broad inclusivity is a small aspect of strong social networks between organizations such that the PI cannot be said to moderately consider the concepts within the attribute.
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Access to knowledge-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in regards to equitable access). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""all affected and relevant stakeholders are represented and no stakeholder groups are excluded based on status, class, gender, ethnicity, etc."" and the ability to participate in collaborative management can directly support equitable access to available information related to decision-making through access to participation. However, the PI cannot be said to partially indicate or assess the extent to which individuals and communities have equitable access to a variety of existing knowledge about the management system, such that the concepts of the attribute are only weakly addressed."
SRA 2.1.2,Stakeholder participation and collaborative management,Transparent-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Transparent (in terms of available to the public and in a timely manner). A high PI score indicates that decisions are transparent, which is a part of this attribute. However, information regarding decisions being available in a form accessible to the public or affected stakeholders is not specifically considered."
SRA 2.2.1,Equitable opportunity to benefit,Access to economic opportunity-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling non-physical means). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""There is evidence of equal access to or opportunity to benefit from the fishery/farm, and marginalized groups are in leadership positions or positions of power"" indicates processes enabling them to benefit from income-earning activities, while its inverse would suggest the opposite. Additionally, the indicator mentions gender transformative policies, which relate to new or alternative income-earning opportunities for women specifically. However, the focus of the indicator is more directly on ensuring distributional equity rather than enabling individuals to take advantage of new economic opportunities."
SRA 2.2.1,Equitable opportunity to benefit,Equitable and inclusive-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of distributional equity). Equal opportunity to benefit and programs to help marginalized groups benefit are indicative of distributional equity, and its inverse would suggest the opposite. However, conceptually the distribution of burdens is not well considered."
SRA 2.2.2,Discrimination,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""there is a comprehensive and proactive anti-discrimination policy for the fishery or farm. The policy is implemented through procedures and practices, posted in all languages and visible to all workers, AND - Managers and workers/fishers/farmers are aware of and trained on the anti-discrimination policy"" would provide some evidence of an example of an activity that would reduce discrimination and thereby protect the agency of individuals regardless of their identities. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the actual capacity of individuals to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will."
SRA 2.2.2,Discrimination,Equitable and inclusive-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). Anti-discrimination policies are part of equitable and inclusive practice and promote fair treatment of marginalized groups, serving as an example of procedural equity-enhancing practice of the employer."
SRA 3.1.1,Food and nutrition security impacts,Wealth and reserves-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Wealth and reserves. Low impact of industrial fisheries on food security protects basic rights of food and nutrition (which are included here as wealth and reserves). However, there are other components included in wealth and reserves that are not captured by food and nutrition security impacts alone."
SRA 3.1.2,Healthcare,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""there is a comprehensive and proactive anti-discrimination policy for the fishery or farm. The policy is implemented through procedures and practices, posted in all languages and visible to all workers, AND - Managers and workers/fishers/farmers are aware of and trained on the anti-discrimination policy"" would provide some evidence of an example of an activity that would reduce discrimination and thereby protect the agency of individuals regardless of their identities. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the actual capacity of individuals to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will."
SRA 3.1.3,Education,Equitable and inclusive-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of distributional equity). While the attribute does not specifically refer to education, achieving a high PI score requirement that ""there is universal access to education through a secondary school level"" provides an example of an activity that directly supports distributional equity in terms of education for youth. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the broader extent to which governance processes are designed to produce fair distribution in outcomes relevant to fishers, fisherworkers, and fishing communities more broadly, nor are burdens considered by this indicator."
SRA 3.1.3,Education,Learning capacity-C2,1,The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Learning capacity (for having the knowledge to pose solutions to risks). Ability to perceive risk and learn from experience are not measured by this indicator.
SRA 3.1.3,Education,Access to knowledge-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in regards to equitable access). A high PI score indicates there is universal access to education, which assists in the capacity to obtain and derive benefits about the fishery system, although the fishery system is not mentioned."
SRA 3.1.3,Education,Access to knowledge-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in terms of the ability to derive benefit). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""there is universal access to education through a secondary school level, via remote learning where relevant, or access to a technical school, or university"" directly supports Access to knowledge-C2. Achieving a high PI score does not include equitable access to available information about the fishery system itself (in terms of employment, fishery operations, or management)."
SRA 3.2.1,Benefits to and within community,Equitable and inclusive-C1,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of distributional equity), as the indicator aims to secure benefits to and within the community. However, burdens are not considered."
SRA 3.2.1,Benefits to and within community,Wealth and reserves-C1/1,2,The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute of Wealth and reserves. Access to wealth and reserves is indicated but not the quantity or quality of wealth and reserves.
SRA 3.2.1,Benefits to and within community,Access to economic opportunity-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling non-physical means). People from the community hold a majority of the access rights or jobs, which indicates access to economic opportunity. New and alternative income-earning options are not included in this indicator."
SRA 3.2.2,Economic value retention,Equitable and inclusive-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of distributional equity). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""formalized training is provided to fishers/farmers in how to add value to their product"" provides an example of an action that could improve distributional equity, although this is not the focus of the indicator such that conceptually distributional equity itself is not considered."
SRA 3.2.2,Economic value retention,Access to economic opportunity-C2,1,"The indicator focused on economic value retention provides weak consideration of the attribute of Access to economic opportunity. An example of a new alternative income-earning activity is directly considered in the high PI score requirement of ""Formalized training is provided to fishers/farmers in how to add value to their product."" However, the ability to benefit from new alternative income-earning activities is not sufficiently considered such that there is only weak conceptual overlap."
SRA 3.2.3,Long-term profitability and future workforce,Wealth and reserves-C1/1,1,The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Wealth and reserves. Long-term operating profit margin above 18% indicates quantity of wealth and reserves but not quality or access to profits within the fishery.
SRA 3.2.4,Economic flexibility and autonomy,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""harvesters are free to sell to whomever they wish without retribution"" falls within the scope of Agency and provides an example of one form of agency. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the broader capacity of individuals and communities to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will in all aspects."
SRA 3.2.4,Economic flexibility and autonomy,Access to knowledge-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in regards to equitable access). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""fishers/farmers know the quality expected of the product, how the price is calculated, and when they will be paid via written contract with buyers"" would directly support access to specific knowledge about the value chain. The PI aims to increase equitable access to available information. However, the PI does not consider equitable access to this information in full or equitable access to a wider breadth of variety of available knowledge about employment."
SRA 3.2.4,Economic flexibility and autonomy,Access to economic opportunity-C2,2,"The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling non-physical means). There is more than one local buyer, indicating diversity of options, and ""fishers have access to credit markets or are recipients of investment opportunities."" Potential income-earning activities outside the fishery are not mentioned in the indicator."
SRA 3.2.4,Economic flexibility and autonomy,Economic diversity-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Economic diversity (for within the fishery but not for outside the fishery). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""there is more than one local fish buyer, and harvesters are free to sell to whomever they wish without retribution"" falls within the scope of Economic diversity-C1 and provides an example of an activity that directly supports economic diversity in terms of market options. However, the PI does not consider or evaluate the broader variety of income-earning activities besides having more than one buyer."
SRA 3.2.4,Economic flexibility and autonomy,Equitable and inclusive-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Equitable and inclusive (in terms of procedural equity). New workers, including women, are being recruited into the workforce, and women are increasingly taking leadership roles in the supply chain and fishing/farming communities provides an example of an activity that directly supports the attribute; however, the concepts within the attribute are not sufficiently addressed."
SRA 3.2.4,Economic flexibility and autonomy,Access to knowledge-C2,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in terms of the ability to derive benefit). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""fishers/farmers know the quality expected of the product, how the price is calculated, and when they will be paid via written contract with buyers"" directly supports knowledge diversity by providing detailed information. However, the PI does not explore the variety of knowledge, such that the conceptual overlap with the attribute component is weak."
SRA 3.2.5,Livelihood security,Access to economic opportunity-C1,3,"The indicator provides strong consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling physical means). Having formal legal access to a portfolio of species groups and the fact that achieving the high PI score requires that ""Male and female fishers/farmers/workers have ownership over the fishing/farming gear needed to fulfill livelihood responsibilities (ice, engines, boats, gear, fuel, bait, etc.)"" indicates direct physical access to economic opportunities within the fishery. Ensuring that men and women have ownership and access to gear, equipment, and species would allow them to capitalize on existing and new income opportunities. Thus, nearly all conceptual aspects of the attribute are considered by the indicator."
SRA 3.2.5,Livelihood security,Wealth and reserves-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Wealth and reserves. Wealth and reserves may be indicated by ownership of all gear needed to fulfill livelihood responsibilities, mainly covering access and minimum quantity of a specific type of wealth and reserves. Other types of assets that are not tied to fishing are not considered by the indicator."
SRA 3.2.5,Livelihood security,Access to economic opportunity-C2,2,The indicator provides moderate consideration of the attribute Access to economic opportunity (in terms of enabling non-physical means). A high PI score indicates non-physical access opportunities to professional development training within the fishery or capacity building either inside the fishery or outside (in alternative livelihoods). Ability to benefit from new alternative income-earning activities is not specifically addressed but is relevant in a changing climate and seafood sector.
SRA 3.2.5,Livelihood security,Agency-C1/1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute of Agency. Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""male and female fishers/farmers/workers have formal (legal) access to a portfolio of species/species groups and gear types"" indicates that having formal legal access and ownership directly supports free will. However, the PI does not consider the broader capacity of individuals and communities to negotiate, make decisions, and act on their own free will."
SRA 3.2.5,Livelihood security,Access to knowledge-C1,1,"The indicator provides weak consideration of the attribute Access to knowledge (in regards to equitable access). Achieving the high PI score requirement that ""male and female fishers/farmers/workers have access to professional development training or capacity building either inside the fishery/farm, or outside (in alternative livelihoods)"" aims to increase equitable access to knowledge regarding employment. However, the PI does not consider equitable access to a wider breadth of available knowledge about employment, such that the concepts of the attribute are only weakly addressed."
